  <h2><i>Introduction about AI: -</i></h2>
      <p>The field of artificial intelligence research was born at Dartmouth College in the
summer of 1956. Where a group of scientists has the credited of creating the term
“artificial intelligence,” they suggested showing every side of learning or any other
feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to
simulate it. It may have been simply in midcentury, but they did what they plan to do.
And in the process, they founded a scientific basis which made a great revolution in
the world at this age. Artificial intelligence is going to change everything (from
exploring the astronomers the edges of our universe. And garrulous digital personal
assistants like Siri and Alexa, genomic-research breakthroughs, immediate language
translation, and self-driving cars) all of them have one key, thing in common: artificial
intelligence or (A.I). So rather than programming for every conceivable scenario,
engineers have given the computers self-teaching programs and general background,
for example, recognize the advanced voice by learning algorithm and proceeded to
feed it terabytes of data, so the computer can be store years’ worth of speech samples,
then it tries to figure it out for itself. This basic formula is being repeated always in
medical diagnosis, self-piloting vehicles, crash-proof drones. Today, it has been
proven that the combination of vast computational power and the enormous storehouse
of data on the internet make the A.I. move from theory to world-changing practice.
This shows the recent evolution of this practice.</p>
