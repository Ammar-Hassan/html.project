        <h3><i>Three things you should know about self-driving cars: -</i></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In late 2015, Tesla Motors made a software update to its vehicles 
                around the world. This company already Install sensors, cameras, GPS and 
                controls onboard the cars to be able to drive autonomous, although, humans are 
                being in the driver’s seat ready to take over if needed. Within weeks, a crew 
                of drivers climbed into a Model (S) in Los Angeles and travel to New York over 
                only two days, the car steering itself 96% of the way. Tesla founder expects 
                that his electric cars will be entirely self-driving by the end of 2020. 
                Mainline carmakers from General Motors to Mercedes-Benz have also promised 
                to sell autonomous vehicles in the next few years. Born-again evangelists of 
                self-driving cars include some of the greatest names in the business, such as 
                William Clay Ford Jr., the executive chairman of the company and Toyota Motor \
                Corp. president Akio Toyoda Maryl, Tennessee, Georgia and Illinois have 
                legalized self-driving cars, and at least 13 more states are mulling similar 
                laws.</p></li>
            <li><p>The computer is better driver than a human because it better 
                at keeping its eyes on other drivers, better at maintaining a steady driving 
                speed and that way maximizing fuel efficiency, better at parsing GPS data, 
                weather data and traffic data. It doesn’t get distracted by a spouse, kids 
                or anything. It doesn’t sneak a glimpse at Snapchat or WhatsApp. The 
                computer couldn’t blink even if it wants. Never persuades itself that harmful 
                weed improves its driving. Asking directions is the favorite activity for the 
                computer, the computer never falls asleep.</p></li>
            <li><p>The economic and safety effects will be very good. There are 
                many statistics to prove that driving puts others’ lives at risk. Self-driving 
                cars and unmanned drones will probably join digital surveillance that 
                Distinguishes our times. Freedom vs. security, the problem is transition from 
                human drivers to more-skillful computers.  And because the gulf between human 
                and machine is very big the next step after making driverless cars legal will 
                be making them mandatory. Who will be responsible for mistakes? How should 
                computers make life and death decisions? Such questions may contort ethicists 
                and lawyers for next years. But all revolutions involve disruption and I think 
                this one will create more than it destroys. Over the world, there are about 
                1.3 million traffic fatalities every year, according to the World Health 
                Organization. On the other hand, 94% of road accidents are the fault of drivers.</p></li>
