 <h3><i> The Deep-Learning Revolution: -</i></h3>

<p>Over the past four years, readers sure have noticed big leaps in the quality of a wide 
    range of technologies, like the speech-recognition function on our smartphones which 
    works now much better than it used to. When we use a voice command to call someone, we 
    reach them now. On the other hand, machine translation, and other forms of language 
    processing have become much more convincing, with Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Baidu 
    discover new tricks every month. Google Translate now offers spoken sentences in 32 pairs 
    of languages and offering text translations for 103 tongues, including Cebuano, Igbo, and 
    Zulu. Google’s Inbox app offers three ready-made replies for a lot of incoming emails.</p>
 <h3><i>Image recognition: -</i></h3>
 <p>
    There is image recognition that developed in the previous period as well. These four 
    companies all have advantages that let you search or automatically organize collections 
    of photos without identifying tags. You can ask to be shown for example all the photos 
    which have dogs in them or snow or even something fairly abstract like hugs. The companies 
    all have formed in the works that generate sentence-long descriptions for the photos in 
    seconds. Think about that for a moment. To collect dog pictures, the app must identify 
    everything from dog breeds and not be made mistakes if the pup is upside down or partially 
    obscured, at the right or the left of the frame, in fog or snow, sun or shade. At the same 
    time, it needs to exclude wolves and cats.

 <h3><i>Using pixels alone. How is that possible?</i></h3>
 <p>
    The image recognition reached far beyond cool social apps. Medical startups claim that they 
    will soon be able to use computers to read x-rays, MRIs, and CT scan more quickly and 
    accurately than radiologists, to diagnose cancer earlier and to accelerate the search for 
    lifesaving medicine. Better image recognition is very important to unleashing improvements 
    in robotics, autonomous drones, and self-driving cars as well. Ford, Tesla, Uber, Baidu,and 
    Google have all been made possible by the artificial-intelligence techniques popularly known 
    as deep learning, Although, most scientists still prefer to call them by their original 
    academic designation: deep neural networks, or nets. The most amazing thing about neural 
    nets is that no one being has programmed a computer to perform any of the stunts described 
    above. In fact, no one could do that. So, programmers have, rather, give the computer 
    a learning algorithm, exposed it to terabytes of data—hundreds of thousands of images or 
    years’ worth of speech samples. In short, such computers can now teach themselves.
