        <h3><i>Robots: - </i></h3>
        <p>            Robots are very intelligent and amazing machines and they will change the future. 
            For example, The FETCH robot picks items off depot shelves then the Freight robot 
            carries them to human workers for packaging. </p>
        <h3><i>Kinds of thought about robots: -</i></h3>
        <p>There are two kinds of thought concerning the coming effect of robots on workers: 
            some warn that they will destroy jobs and those who think that new technology will 
            boost the productivity of workers without replacing workers. Melonee Wise is one 
            of the optimists. She is the CEO of the based {Fetch Robotics} which working on 
            “collaborative robotics,” using machines to do things humans cannot. She says 
            “Once we start seeing more service robots as we make, people will be like, ‘These 
            things are really improving my life,’”. Fetch is developing robots for the depot. 
            One model, called (Freight), looks like a muscled version of the floor-sweeping 
            (Roomba robot) made by (iRobot). Freight carries a bin and follows human workers; 
            they pick items off shelves. Another one, nicknamed (Fetch), is an advanced robot 
            with an arm that can take items and work with Freight. According to data firm CB 
            Insights. Much of the possible for a new wave of robots has come from development 
            in so-called machine learning, the software that helps give robots intelligence.</p>
            <h3><i>Are robots represent a dangerous revolution?</i></h3>
            <p>            There is a basic question about robots’ role in the workplace. Wise, who holds 
                a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois and 
                a Chicago native, assert that Fetch’s bots will help warehouse workers to avoid 
                injury and strain, which making them more productive in the long term. Although 
                in the end increase productivity as well as economic and job growth, however, 
                comparing robots to PCs caused consternation. Wise says that “Everyone keeps 
                trying to make a distinction between a robot and a computer, but they’re the 
                same thing,” and “A robot is a computer wrapped in plastic.” but not everyone 
                is convinced. Martin Ford says about the technology and the Threat of a Jobless 
                Future, “Technology is going to get to the point where it’s going to take over 
                a lot of the routine, predictable-type jobs in the economy,” That is already 
                happening at checkout lines, tollbooths, parking lots and ticket counters. 
                But Ford and others argue that the combination of robots and artificial 
                intelligence represents a revolution that could in the end take over for high 
                professions. says J.P. Gownder, a vice president and principal analyst at 
                research firm Forrester, “Maybe in 30 or 40 years we will have 50% of the jobs 
                disappear,”, “But I don’t see it happening in the next 10.” So, in your opinion, 
                are the robots dangerous?</p>
