<p>Basic AI Concepts is important to study these concepts to understand how AI
    functions at its most rudimentary level. It would be very hard to read about AI without
    doing this initial study.</p>
 <h3><i>Boolean algebra: -</i></h3>
<p>George Boole created Boolean algebra in 1847. It is an algebra where variable values
     are the truth values (true and false) or 1 and 0, respectively. There are a very few basic
     Boolean operations which are much used in AI expressions. These operations are
     listed for variables A and B.</pre>
     <h3><i>Some basic Boolean operations: -</i></h3>
<p>A AND B
A OR B<br>
NEGATE A<br>
NEGATE B<br>
The expression [A AND B] may also be represented by {A * B} in which the (*) sign 
represents the AND’ing operation. It is not a true analog to the general multiplication 
symbol used in ordinary algebra, but it is near that most people use it interchangeably. 
Similarly, the expression [A OR B] can be represented by {A + B}, where this has the 
same observation holds for the normal (+) sign used in regular algebra. The NEGATE 
or complement operation is unary which meaning it only uses one operand or variable; 
whereas AND & OR requiring two logical variables. The NEGATE operation has a 
formal symbol (¬), but it is not widely used in programs. So, a bar placed over the 
symbol is commonly used in most logical expressions. 
The next Table shows the output resulting from various A and B inputs for the 
operations which just mentioned. Note that the variable C to represent the outputs.</p>

<p>Logical symbols can easily be arranged to form simple and complex Boolean 
    algebraic expressions. Like the AND’ing operation may be expressed as [C = A *B]. It 
    should not be hard to realize that it can be created more complex expressions by using 
    more than two variables and combined using these basic operations. However, the important 
    point is that eventually, all expressions resolve to a true or false, 1 or 0 output. 
    There are also three secondary operations used in Boolean algebra: <br> 
    EXCLUSIVE OR <br>
    MATERIAL IMPLICATION <br> 
    EQUIVALENCE <br> 
    You need to understand some more basic Boolean algebra laws. They are briefly described here. <br> 
    This is an example of De Morgan’s law: <br> 
    (A *B) = A + B <br>
    (A + B) = A * B <br> 
    This is an example of associativity:<br>
    (A * B) * C = A * (B * C) <br> 
    (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) <br> 
    This is an example of commutativity: <br>
     A * B = B * A <br> A + B = B + A <br> 
     This is an example of distributivity: <br> 
     A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C) <br> 
     A + (B * C) = (A +B) * (A +C) </p>
<h3><i>Expert Systems: -</i></h3>
<p>
    It is a computer program designed to use facts present in a specific problem domain, 
    then develop conclusions about those facts as a human expert reasoning with the same 
    facts and reaching conclusions. Such a program would need access to all the facts in 
    the domain, as well as be programmed many rules which a human expert would follow 
    regarding those facts and getting conclusions from the same facts. Sometimes this 
    program is known as a rules-based or knowledge-based system.
